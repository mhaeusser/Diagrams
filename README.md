# Diagrams
Collection of diagrams created e.g. with PlantUML and Typora Markdown



You need plantuml.jar. Unfortunately, you cannot download the file automatically with wget or so. You have  to download in manually from https://sourceforge.net/projects/plantuml/files/latest/download and put it into this folder. Also see http://plantuml.com/starting.

Some diagrams require an installation of graphviz (https://www.graphviz.org/download/ â†’ https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html).
